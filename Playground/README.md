# Mobile Apps Playground 

Welcome to the MSTG Playground for Android and iOS. This is a collection of mobile apps, intentionally build insecure. These apps are used as examples to demonstrate different vulnerabilites explained in the the Mobile Security Testing Guide. 

You are invited to extend the existing apps or even create your own one. Please ping [Sven Schleier](https://github.com/sushi2k "Sven Schleier") for any questions.
