## Testing Platform Interaction on iOS

### Testing Custom URL Schemes

#### Overview

In contrast to Android's rich Inter-Process Communication (IPC) facilities, iOS is offering only very few options for apps to talk to each other. In fact, there is no way for apps to communicate directly. Instead, Apple offers [two ways of indirect communication](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/iPhone/Conceptual/iPhoneOSProgrammingGuide/Inter-AppCommunication/Inter-AppCommunication.html): Sending Files between apps through AirDrop, and custom URL schemes.

Custom URL schemes allow an app to communicate with other apps through a custom protocol. For this to work, an app must declare support for the scheme and handle incoming URLs that use the scheme. Once the URL scheme is registered, other apps can open the app and pass parameters by creating an appropriately formatted URL and opening it using the `openURL` method.

Security issues arise when an app processes calls to its URL scheme without properly validating the URL and its parameters, or if the user is not prompted for confirmation before triggering a critical action.

A nice example it the following [bug in the Skype Mobile app](http://www.dhanjani.com/blog/2010/11/insecure-handling-of-url-schemes-in-apples-ios.html) discovered in 2010. The Skype app registered the `skype://` protocol handler, which allowed other apps to trigger calls to other Skype users and phone numbers. Unfortunately, Skype didn't ask the user for permission before placing the call, so it was possible for any app to call arbitrary numbers (without the user's knowledge if they weren't looking at their phone).

Attackers exploited this vulnerability by putting an invisible `<iframe src=”skype://xxx?call"></iframe>` (where `xxx` was replaced by a premium number), so any Skype user who visited a malicious website inadvertently called the premium number.

#### Static Analysis

The first step is to find out if an application registers any protocol handlers. This information can be found in `info.plist` file in the application sandbox folder. To view registered protocol handlers, simply open a project in Xcode, go to `Info` tab and open `URL Types` section, as it is presented on a below screenshot.

![Document Overview](Images/Chapters/0x06h/URL_scheme.png)

Then, you should verify how an URL path is built and validated. A method responsible for handling user's URLs is called [`openURL`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiapplication/1648685-openurl?language=objc). Look for implemented controls - how an URL is validated (what input it accepts) and does it need the permission of the user when using the custom URL schema?

In a compiled application, you can find registered protocol handlers in a `Info.plist` file under the `CFBundleURLTypes` and then under `CFBundleURLSchemes` key. To find out an URL structure, you can simply use `strings` or `Hooper`:

```sh
$ strings <yourapp> | grep "myURLscheme://"
```

#### Dynamic Analysis

Once you have identified the custom URL scheme's registered by the app in its `Info.plist`, open the URLs on Safari and observer how the app behaves.

If parts of the URL are parsed by the app, you can perform input fuzzing to detect memory corruption bugs. To do it you may use [IDB](http://www.idbtool.com/) tool:

- Connect IDB tool with your device and select tested application. You can find a detailed guide how to do it in the [IDB documentation](http://www.idbtool.com/documentation/setup.html). 
- Go to `URL Handlers` section. In `URL schemes` click `Refresh` button and you will find on the left a list of all custom schemes defined in tested application. You can load those schemes using `Open` button on the right side. By simply opening blank URI scheme (e.g. open `myURLscheme://`) you may discover hidden functionality (e.g. debug window) or bypass local authentication.
- To find out if custom URI schemes contain any bugs you should try to fuzz them. In `URL Handlers` section go to `Fuzzer` tab. On left side are listed default IDB payloads. The [FuzzDB](https://github.com/fuzzdb-project/fuzzdb) project offers useful fuzzing dictionaries. Once your payload list is ready go to `Fuzz Template` section in the left bottom panel and define a template. Use `$@$` to define an injection point, for example:

```sh
myURLscheme://$@$
```

While the URL scheme is being fuzzed, watch the logs (in Xcode go to `Window -> Devices ->` *click on your device* `->` *bottom console contains logs*) to observe an impact of each payload. On the right side of IDB `Fuzzer` tab, you can see a history of used payloads.

#### Remediation

You should carefully validate any URL, before calling it. You can white-list applications which may be opened via the registered protocol handler. Another helpful control is prompting a user for confirming the action, invoked by an URL.

### Testing iOS WebViews

#### Overview

WebViews are in-app browser components for displaying interactive web content. They can be used to embed web content directly into an app's user interface. 

iOS WebViews support execution of JavaScript by default, so they can be affected by script injection and cross-site scripting attacks. Starting from iOS version 7.0, Apple also introduced APIs that enable communication between the JavaScript runtime in the WebView and the native Swift or Objective-C app. If these APIs are used carelessly, important functionality might be exposed to attackers if that manage to inject malicious script into the WebView (e.g through a successful cross-site scripting attack).

Besides the potential for script injection, there is another fundamental security issue related to WebViews: The WebKit libraries packaged with iOS do not get updated out-of-band like the Safari web browser. Therefore, any newly discovered WebKit vulnerabilities remain exploitable until the next full iOS update [#THIEL].

#### Static Analysis

WebViews can be implemented using the following components:

- [UIWebView](https://developer.apple.com/reference/uikit/uiwebview "UIWebView reference documentation") (for iOS versions 7.1.2 and older)
- [WKWebView](https://developer.apple.com/reference/webkit/wkwebview "WKWebView reference documentation") (for iOS in version 8.0 and later). 
- [SFSafariViewController](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safariservices/sfsafariviewcontroller)

`UIWebView` is deprecated and should not be used. Verify that either WKWebView or SafariViewController are used to embed web content depending on the scenario:

- `WKWebView` is the appropriate choice if the goal is to extend the functionality of the app, content is displayed in a controlled fashion (i.e. the user is not meant to navigate to arbitrary URLs), and customization is required.
- `SafariViewController` should be used when the goal is to provide a provide a generalized web viewing experience. Note that `SafariViewController` shares cookies and other website data with Safari. 

Compared the `UIWebView`, `WKWebView` comes with several security advantages:

- The `JavaScriptEnabled` property can be used to completely disable JavaScipt in the WKWebView. This prevents any kind of script injection flaws. 
- The `JavaScriptCanOpenWindowsAutomatically` can be used to prevent opening of new windows from JavaScript. This prevents JavaScript code from opening irritating pop-up windows from opening.
- the `hasOnlySecureContent` property can be used to verify that all resources loaded by the WebView have been retrieved through encrypted connections.
- WKWebView implements out-of-process rendering, so any memory corruption bugs won't affect the main app process.

As a best practice, JavaScript should be disabled in a `WKWebView` unless explicitly required. The following code sample shows a sample configuration.

```objective-c
#import "ViewController.h"
#import <WebKit/WebKit.h>
@interface ViewController ()<WKNavigationDelegate,WKUIDelegate>
@property(strong,nonatomic) WKWebView *webView;
@end

@implementation ViewController

- (void)viewDidLoad {

    NSURL *url = [NSURL URLWithString:@"http://www.example.com/"];
    NSURLRequest *request = [NSURLRequest requestWithURL:url];
    WKPreferences *pref = [[WKPreferences alloc] init];

    //Disable javascript execution:
    [pref setJavaScriptEnabled:NO];
    [pref setJavaScriptCanOpenWindowsAutomatically:NO];

    WKWebViewConfiguration *conf = [[WKWebViewConfiguration alloc] init];
    [conf setPreferences:pref];
    _webView = [[WKWebView alloc]initWithFrame:CGRectMake(self.view.frame.origin.x,85, self.view.frame.size.width, self.view.frame.size.height-85) configuration:conf] ;
    [_webView loadRequest:request];
    [self.view addSubview:_webView];

}
```

##### Exposing Native Objects to WebViews

###### UIWebView

Since iOS 7, the JavaScriptCore framework provides an Objective-C wrapper to the WebKit JavaScript engine. This makes it possible to execute JavaScript from Swift and Objective-C, as well as making Objective-C and Swift objects accessible from the JavaScript runtime. If native functionality is carelessly exposing, it could be exploited by an attacker who manages to inject JavaScript into the WebView.

A JavaScript execution environment is represented by a `JSContext` object. Look out for code that maps native objects to the `JSContext` associated with a WebView. In Objective-C, the `JSContext` associated with a `UIWebView` is obtained as follows:

``objective-c
[webView valueForKeyPath:@"documentView.webView.mainFrame.javaScriptContext"]
``

- Objective-C blocks. When an Objective-C block is assigned to an identifier in a JSContext, JavaScriptCore automatically wraps the block in a JavaScript function.

- JSExport protocol: Properties, instance methods, and class methods declared in an JSExport-inherited protocol are mapped to JavaScript objects that are made available to any JavaScript code. Modifications made to the objects in the JavaScript environment are reflected in the native environment.

Note that only class members defined in the `JSExport` protocol only members are made accessible to JavaScript code.

###### WKWebView

In contrast to `UIWebView`, it is not possible to directly reference the `JSContext` of a `WKWebView`. 


```javascript
window.webkit.messageHandlers.interOp.postMessage(message)
```


```objective-c

- (void)userContentController:(WKUserContentController *)userContentController 
                            didReceiveScriptMessage:(WKScriptMessage *)message{
    NSLog(@"%@", message.body);
}
```



#### Dynamic Analysis

A Dynamic Analysis depends on different surrounding conditions, as there are different possibilities to inject JavaScript into a WebView of an application:

- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in an endpoint, where the exploit will be sent to the WebView of the Mobile App when navigating to the vulnerable function.
- Man-in-the-middle (MITM) position by an attacker where he is able to tamper the response by injecting JavaScript.

In order to address these attack vectors, the outcome of the following checks should be verified:

- that all functions offered by the endpoint need to be free of [XSS vulnerabilities](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/XSS_(Cross_Site_Scripting\)\_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet "XSS (Cross Site Scripting) Prevention Cheat Sheet").

- that the HTTPS communication need to be implemented according to the best practices to avoid MITM attacks (see "Testing Network Communication").

### Testing Jailbreak Detection

#### Overview

iOS implements containerization so that each app is restricted to its own sandbox. A regular app cannot access files outside its dedicated data directories, and access to system APIs is restricted via app privileges. As a result, an app’s sensitive data as well as the integrity of the OS is guaranteed under normal conditions. However, when an adversary gains root access to the mobile operating system, the default protections can be bypassed completely.

The risk of malicious code running as root is higher on jailbroken devices, as many of the default integrity checks are disabled. Developers of apps that handle highly sensitive data should therefore consider implementing checks that either prevent the app from running under these conditions, or at least warn the user about the increased risks.

#### Static Analysis

Look for a function with a name like isJailBroken in the code. If none of these are available, look for code checking for the following:
1. Existence of files (such as anything with cydia or substrate in the name (such as `/private/var/lib/cydia or /Library/MobileSubstrate/MobileSubstrate.dylib`), `/var/lib/apt, /bin/bash, /usr/sbin/sshd, sftp`, etc). In swift this is done with the `FileManager.default.fileExists(atPath: filePath)` function and objective-c uses `[NSFileManager defaultManager] fileExistsAtPath:filePath`, so grepping for fileExists should show you a good list.
2. Changes of directory permissions (ie being able to write to a file outside the apps own directory - common examples are `/, /private, /lib, /etc, /System, /bin, /sbin, /cores, /etc`). /private and / seem to be the most commonly used for testing.

	2.1 Check actual permissions themselves: Swift uses `NSFilePosixPermissions` and objective-c uses `directoryAttributes`, so grep for these.

	2.2 Check if you can write a file: Swift and objective-c both use the key words `write` and `create` for file and directory writing and creation. So grep for this and pipe to a grep for `/private` (or others) to get a reference.
3. Checking size of `/etc/fstab` - a lot of tools modify this file, but this method is uncommon as an update from apple may break this check.
4. Creation of symlinks due to the jailbreak taking up space on the system partition. Look for references to `/Library/Ringtones,/Library/Wallpaper,/usr/arm-apple-darwin9,/usr/include,/usr/libexec,/usr/share,/Applications` in the code.

#### Dynamic Analysis

First try running on a jailbroken device and see what happens. If a jailbreak detection is implemented use [Cycript](http://www.cycript.org/ "cycript") to examine the methods for any obvious anti-Jailbreak type name (e.g. `isJailBroken`). Note this requires a jailbroken iOS device with Cycript installed and shell access (via ssh). Also, at time of writing, Cycript cannot manipulate native Swift code (but can still look at any Objective-C libraries that are called). To tell if the app is written in Swift use the [nm tool](https://developer.apple.com/legacy/library/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/nm.1.html "nm tool"):

```
nm <appname> | grep swift
```
For an Objective-C only app there will be no output. However, it is still possible the app is mixed Swift and Objective-C.

```
cycript -p <AppName>
cy#[ObjectiveC.classes allKeys]
```

It is recommended you pipe this to a file, then search for something that sounds like a promising classname like jailbreak, startup, system, initial, load, etc. Once you have a candidate list the methods:

```
cy#printMethods(<classname>)
```

Again, you may want to pipe to a file and go through it for a promising sounding method (e.g. has jail or root in the title).

#### Remediation

For iOS jailbreaking, it is worth noting that a determined hacker (or tester!) could use Cycript's method swizzling to modify this function to always return true. Of course there are more complex implementations, but nearly all can be subverted - the idea is just to make it harder. As such the following is recommended:
1. Use more than one of the above methods to check if a device is jailbroken.
2. Call the class and method something that is not immediately obvious (but it well commented).
3. Use Swift instead of Objective-C.
